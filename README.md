### GAMIFICATION ON COMPUTER PROGRAMMING

## Abstract
All over the world, traditional education system does not motivate people to learn. Because of this tedious system, people start to become less interested in learning. The popularization of computer games has created a new path for education for life long time. Digital game-based learning ensures motivational and enjoyable way to learn new information. The main goal of this study is that developed web-based game to encourage students to learn programming terms in an enjoyable way.

**Keywords:** 
Digital Game-Based Learning, Educational Game Design, Learning Process, Object Oriented, Git / GitHub Platforms

## Purpose

This documentation is a description of the game, the requirements analysis, the flow chart, and the members of the project team. The purpose of this project is to use Git / GitHub concepts, to apply the information given in place. The reason we chose this project is that we are going to be able to use the Git platform efficiently and consistently. At the same time, we will update our lecture information about website and database at the university. 
After the user sign in system, the questions of programming terminology will print on the screen according to the user level. These will automatically come from the text file we prepared up to 10 letter words from 4 letter words randomly. The user will have a limited time and hint to know this word. At the point where the word does not know or the end of time, the character belonging to the user will be printed on the screen.

## Used Technology

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6 (Pure JS)
- JSON 
- Google Firebase
- Twitter Bootstrap 4
- SVG
- Git / Git Hub

## HTML5
HTML5 is Markup language version 5. It is for web design.

## JavaScript ES6 (Pure JS)

JS is a scripting language, the fastest way to create an interactive site. It progresses with ECMAScript standards. At the moment many browsers are beginning to support new versions of EcmaScript6. The most important reason for choosing this language is that it is fast learnable, easy to develop and the community is advanced. It is also the best choice for working with other browsers to prepare web based games.

## Google Firebase

Google Firebase is Google's service provider of many tools for developers. Notifications sent to mobile apps include content such as ads displayed on mobile, storage, real-time database operations, test systems, crash reporting / previewing services, authorization service. We will use this system to keep the user record. Google offers services at basic level without charge.

## Twitter Bootstrap 4

A mobile-first component library with many components, with a robust grid structure for sensitive site preparation that every front-end developer needs to have in his / her pocket. The community is strong, with Twitter behind. It offers easy solutions for layout preparation like Flex structure.

## SVG

It is easy to create manipulable graphics. We can get options like adding animation. 

## OAuth and Github

We will use it if users need to login directly with Github, not with username / password. Examples are available for JavaScript. We will be able to keep the data with the Google Firebase, such as the email username we receive here. We will have a nice login screen on this.

## Testing 

-	There must be exist user for playing game ( Control with FireBase ) 
-	Sign in / Sign Up Button Control 
-	Session Control
-	Score List Control
-	Calculating Score Control 
-	Letter Control 
-	Flow Control ( in Game )
