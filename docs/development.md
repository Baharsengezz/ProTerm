# Development Stages Of ProTerm

## What We Use?

##### Node.JS

In JavaScript development mostly we use Node.JS, because the Node.Js provides to us a Package Manager (a.k.a NPM). Npm is **imho** best thing for the JS developers. Also **yarn** can be alternative to NPM (Actually the YARN is a NPM client who has some pros.)

**Libraries**

- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extra
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) - Browserify lets you *require('modules')* in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
